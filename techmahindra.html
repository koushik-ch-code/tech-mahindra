    <h2 id="history">HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
        Mahindra & Mahindra started a joint venture with British Telecom in 1986 as a technology outsourcing firm. At that point in time the company was named Mahindra British Telecom (MBT). Later it was renamed as Tech Mahindra. British Telecom initially had around a 30 percent stake in Tech Mahindra. In December 2010, British Telecom sold 5.5 percent of its stake in Tech Mahindra to Mahindra & Mahindra for Rs. 451 crore.[12] In August 2012, British Telecom sold 14.1 percent of its stake to institutional investors for about Rs. 1,395 crore. In December 2012, British Telecom sold its remaining 9.1 per cent (11.6 million shares) shareholding to institutional investors for a total gross cash proceeds of Rs. 1,011.4 crores. This sale marked the exit of British Telecom from Tech Mahindra.[13][14]

Acquisition of Satyam Computer Services Ltd.
After the Satyam scandal of 2008â€“09, Tech Mahindra bid for Satyam Computer Services, and emerged as a top bidder with an offer of INR 58.90 a share for a 31 percent stake in the company, beating a strong rival, Larsen & Toubro.[15] After evaluating the bids, the government-appointed board of Satyam Computer announced on April 13, 2009: "its Board of Directors has selected Venturbay Consultants Private Limited, a subsidiary controlled by Tech Mahindra Limited, as the highest bidder to acquire a controlling stake in the Company, subject to the approval of the Hon'ble Company Law Board."[16]
